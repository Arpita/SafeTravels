# SafeTravels
WebApp for enabling people, especially women to travel without any fear, be it alone or late in the night.

Please load desktop.html to see a demo version. Random current positions are generated for testing the application on desktop.

For mobile devices please load mobile.html. This uses the device's current location.

Things to be done:
Plenty!
1. Integrate alarm notifications either using device APIs or platform specific calls. Also, once alarms are integrated, need to have configurable stop time for the alarms.
2. Make a provision for being able to select a tolerance level.
2. Also, need to integrate with a messaging server for being able to send sms messages to registered contacts.
3. Loads of error handling!
